Hi, my name is Mat! A little bit about me:

I am a husband to a loving wife, and father to five wonderful fur critters (two dogs and three cats). I'm currently working on deepening my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming, Embedded Systems Design, and FPGA Development. When I'm not working on those I can be found in my garage workshop making signs to sell on [Etsy](https://web.archive.org/web/20230531033804/https://mkrbuilds.etsy.com/?ref=mathew-rupp) or working on one of a million other projects.
